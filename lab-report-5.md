# Lab Report 5

A lab report that I liked was lab report 3. I liked the idea of looking up commands and learning what they do. It helped me look up ccertain commands that helped me with the skill demo that week like using -rl to find a certain file. I also feel like it's something that I would do outside of this class. I know eventually I will have to look up how to use a certain command or the different options I can use with it. This time to do it differently I will use some options of the find command. Also using ChatGPT as the way to find out how to use the options.

## find -name
